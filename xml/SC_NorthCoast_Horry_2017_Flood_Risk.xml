      <abstract>2017 predictions were generated from stream gages (USGS) and tide station (Springmaid Pier, NOAA). The stream gauge sources (only gauges with more than 3 years of data were used) average yearly high gage elevation was used as the mean yearly flooding surface and the standard deviation of the yearly high values used to assign the relative yearly flooding risk percentages. The process used the DEM derived stream network to help generate the surfaces – both mean and standard deviation. The tide station – 8661070 – still water surge values and statistics were used to reconstruct a normal curve for the station and this information, mean and standard deviation, were used to generate the still water surge surfaces. The still water surge does not include wave affects (run-up) so it is a conservative estimate of flooding extents and does not include the many different approach angle and speed variants. The FEMA flood zone along the coast is significantly larger as a result of modeling waves and the potential for storms beyond the present data set.These surfaces -stream flooding and still water surge were combined using the maximum value. They are used as the present condition – and represent an empirical data set. The mean surface was then subtracted from a 5 m DEM (derived from 2 m DEM) and then divided by the standard deviation to arrive at Z-scores which were converted to percent (%) values.</abstract>
      <purpose>Predicted yearly flood risks were developed from empirical data (measured) in Horry County at stream gages and the Springmaid Pier tide gage. The data provide a yearly chance (risk) of the location being flooded from river/ocean sources. Ponding water/poor drainage sources are not included. </purpose>
