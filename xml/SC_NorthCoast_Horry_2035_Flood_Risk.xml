      <abstract>The projected yearly flood risk for 2035 was created using the 2017 predicted flooding risk surfaces as a base. The values were offset (increased) based on the EPA’s Stormy future scenario for the area (CREAT; Climate Scenarios Projection Map) which indicates a 14% (2035) increase in the 100 yr storm intensity for 2035. The increases at the 99% level (offset from present) were calculated for each river gage station and a 2035 surface calculated based on each stations increase in gage elevations. In areas near the coast (~10 miles) the 2017 predicted flooding risk surface also included SLR considerations. SLR values were taken from the USACE Climate Change Adaption site using the values from Springmaid Pier (8661070). The values from 5 curves were used (NOAA and USACE) and the average SLR for each time computed along with the standard deviation of the estimates to generate statistics. These surfaces -stream flooding and still water surge were combined using the maximum value. The mean surface was then subtracted from a 5 m DEM (derived from 2 m DEM) and then divided by the standard deviation to arrive at Z-scores which were converted to percent (%) values.</abstract>
      <purpose>Projected yearly flood risks for 2035 were developed from projections starting with empirical data (2017 Predicted Yearly Flooding Risks) in Horry County at stream gages and the Springmaid Pier tide gage. These data were projected to 2035 using EPA (rainfall), NOAA, and USACE (sea level) climate trends. The data provide a yearly chance (risk) of the location being flooded from river/ocean sources. Ponding water/poor drainage sources are not included.  </purpose>
